Python Calculator using Tkinter

This project is a simple calculator application developed using Python and the Tkinter library. The application provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for performing basic arithmetic operations. It showcases fundamental principles of GUI design and event handling in Python.

Features: 

Basic Arithmetic Operations: Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Clear and Backspace Functions: Allows users to clear the current input or remove the last character.
Error Handling: Displays "error" if an invalid calculation is attempted.
Responsive Layout: The calculator layout adjusts dynamically to screen size, maintaining a user-friendly interface.

Code Explanation:

add(value) Function: Appends the clicked button's value to the current expression and updates the display.
clear() Function: Resets the expression and clears the display.
calculate() Function: Evaluates the current expression and displays the result. Handles errors such as invalid expressions.
backspace() Function: Removes the last character from the current expression.

Layout

The GUI is composed of:
A display label at the top showing the current expression or result.
Buttons arranged in a grid for digits (0-9), basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /), and special functions (clear, backspace, equals).
